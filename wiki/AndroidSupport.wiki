Many users complain that oppo-touching didn't support Android, I did lots of investigation and make this report, hope it can help you. 

= Introduction =

Android OS grows very quickly, it takes different version of Webkit Core at different OS. So it is not easy to say Oppo-touching didn't support Android. I just try every Android OS and let you know the supported version.

The list of supported Android OS:
  * Android OS Launchpad;
  * Open the browser and access Sencha Touch example;
  * Go to Oppo charting;
  * charting list;
  * Area chart;
  * Mixed chart;
  * Grouped bar chart;
  * Radar chart;
