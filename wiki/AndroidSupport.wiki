Many users complain that oppo-touching didn't support Android, I did lots of investigation and made this report, hope it can help you. 

= Introduction =

Android OS grows very quickly, it takes different version of Webkit Core at different OS. So it is difficult to say Oppo-touching didn't support Android. I just try every Android OS and let you know the supported version.
